Francium is a highly radioactive alkali metal and the second rarest naturally occurring element.  
It has a very short half-life; its most stable isotope, francium-223, decays in about 22 minutes, making it difficult to study.  
Because of its rarity and radioactivity, francium has no commercial applications and is primarily of interest in scientific research.
