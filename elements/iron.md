Symbol : Fe
Atomic Number : 26
Iron is the second most abundant metal on Earth, forming much of the core, as well as the crust from collisions with meteorites (which are almost entirely made of iron).
Iron is also in our blood cells, and reacts with oxygen to form a red color, which is why our blood and rust are red.
Iron alloys such as steel (iron mixed with carbon) can be very strong.
