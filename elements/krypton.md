Krypton, a noble gas, is known for its rarity in the atmosphere, making up only about 0.0001%. 
It is also chemically inert, meaning it rarely reacts with other elements, though it can form compounds with fluorine. 
Commercially, krypton is used in lighting, particularly in energy-saving fluorescent lights and high-speed photography flash lamps.
