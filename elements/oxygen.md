Oxygen is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table. 

Oxygen is a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxide with most elements as well as with other compounds. 

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust, making up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxide and silicates.
